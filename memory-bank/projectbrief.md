# Project Brief

Browser-based dodge-and-survive game built in a single `index.html`. The player controls a red ball pursued by black enemy balls, with rounds, power-ups, multiple lives via additional red balls, and configurable difficulty. Visual theme is neon/space-like.

## Goals
- Provide a simple keyboard-controlled survival game with escalating challenge.
- Support multiple difficulty presets and a clean start flow with countdown and audio cues.
- Keep everything client-side with minimal dependencies.

## Deliverable
- A self-contained HTML/CSS/JS experience runnable in the browser, featuring difficulty selection, restart flow, power-ups, and multi-ball behavior.
