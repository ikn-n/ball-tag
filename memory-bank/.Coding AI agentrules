# .Coding AI agentrules

- Always read memory-bank files on new sessions; core docs: projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext, activeContext, progress.
- Game specifics:
  - Difficulty menu shows on load and right-click; HUD shows difficulty; difficulty sets starting enemy count and speed deltas.
  - Countdown with beeps must run before gameplay after selecting difficulty or clicking restart.
  - After loss, no auto-restart; show Restart button and require click to restart with countdown.
  - Clone spawning capped at 15; spacebar spawns clones near active red.
  - Enemies spawn near corners/edges, chase nearest red; flee when invincible; speed ramp capped after round 15.
  - Power-ups: one at a time per round after delay; speed boost tied to collector, invincibility global; any red can collect.
  - Background uses lighter neon gradient/glow; keep contrast for black balls.
- Keep code self-contained in `index.html`; avoid adding external assets unless requested.
