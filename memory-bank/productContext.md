# Product Context

## Why it exists
Provide a quick-play browser game where players dodge chasing enemies, with light power-ups and difficulty presets to vary the challenge.

## How it should work
- Player moves a controllable red ball with arrow keys; other red balls act as decoys/autopilot.
- Black balls home in on the nearest red unless invincibility is active (then they flee).
- Rounds add enemies; speed ramps (capped) and difficulty presets adjust starting conditions.
- Power-ups spawn mid-round (speed boost or invincibility) and can be collected by any red ball.
- Clone spawning via spacebar up to a cap.
- Difficulty menu accessible on load and via right-click; restart button used after loss.
- Countdown with audio runs before play starts.

## Experience goals
- Fast to start, minimal friction in difficulty selection.
- Clear visual contrast (neon backdrop, glowing elements, distinct power-up colors).
- Responsive controls and clear state transitions (countdown, status text, restart).

## Audience
- Casual players seeking a lightweight browser dodge/avoid game with configurable difficulty.
